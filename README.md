## Simple To Do Application

An application to be run in a browser. These are basic set up instructions.

[Preview on codepen.io](https://codepen.io/lexria/pen/xazeGx)

### Create basic files

1. index.html
2. main.js
3. style.css

### Download jQuery file

Use the file so that if the internet is unavailable your application can still run jQuery.

1. Download the file from the [jQuery website](https://jquery.com/download/)
2. Place in your repository.

### Reference your files in the html header

I used [fonts from google](https://fonts.google.com/) to include in my project. Reference links to fonts the same as you would a file.
```
<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Carter+One|Lato" rel="stylesheet">
```

```
<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
```
```
<script src="jquery-3.3.1.min.js"></script>
```
```
<script src="main.js"></script>
```

### Test in browser as you work

* Double click the index.html to view your work in the browser. 
* Work on your files and save changes.
* Refresh the browser to update your session and test the changes.

### Things to keep in mind

* Don't delete your work. Having a history of things you've tried can only benefit you.
* Be careful with copy pasting. Pay extra attention when reworking code taken from somewhere else.
* Google your way to the top. Most likely, your questions have been asked and answered before.
* Ask for help. A second pair of eyes and a fresh perspective can help tackle bugs you get stuck on.
