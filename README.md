## Simple To Do Application
An application to be run in a browser. These are basic set up instructions.

[Preview on codepen.io](https://codepen.io/lexria/pen/xazeGx)

### Create basic files
1. index.html
2. main.js
3. style.css

### Download jQuery file
Use the file so that if the internet is unavailable your application can still run jQuery.

1. Download the file from the [jQuery website](https://jquery.com/download/)
2. Place in your repository.

### Reference your files in the html header

I used fonts from google to include in my project. Reference links to fonts the same as you would a file.
```
<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Carter+One|Lato" rel="stylesheet">
```

```
<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
```
```
<script src="jquery-3.3.1.min.js"></script>
```
```
<script src="main.js"></script>
```

### Test in browser as you work
Double click the index.html to view your work in the browser. When you save changes, refresh the browser to update your session and see the changes.

### Things to keep in mind
* Don't delete your work. Having a history of things you've tried can only benefit you.
* Be careful with copy pasting. Pay extra attention when reworking code taken from somewhere else.
* Google your way to the top. Most likely, your questions have been asked and answered before.
* Ask for help. A second pair of eyes and a fresh perspective can help tackle bugs you get stuck on.
